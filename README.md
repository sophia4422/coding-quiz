# Quiz Theme

The styling of the quiz is inspired by Spotify. I have used their housestyle colours and I have incorporated a similar font to the one they use.

# How to Play

The aim of the quiz is to answer the questions correctly in as little time as possible.
You are given 10 seconds for every question. However, if you answer a question incorrectly, 10 seconds is deducted from the timer.
The time remaining on the clock when you complete the quiz becomes your score. Therefore, the more time remaining = a high score.

Your scores are saved into local storage and can be viewed on the 'Highscores' page. Clearing the highscores will clear your local storage.

# Quiz Theme

When the homework was first presented, I wanted to make the quiz about music. I had an idea of doing a black/green Spotify inspired design. The questions would involve, finish the lyric, guess the album cover, name that song etc. However, for the purposes of time constraints I thought it would be in my best interest to neglect the css and focus more on the functionality of Javascript.

I did not want my quiz to focus solely on code related questions. I decided instead to do a random, general knowledge quiz, with coding included. I started with four basic questions:

**Question 1: What is the capital of Brazil?**
<br> Answers: Brasilia, Rio de Janeiro, SÃ£o Paulo, Ouro Preto

# Meeting the Brief

The page loads to show a nav bar with a home button and a high scores button. A title, description and start button show. The page is mobile responsive. Unfortunately, the appearance of the quiz is not how I would have liked it to look. I did not put much time into the css in order to make time for the JavaScript.

When the Start Quiz button is clicked, the first question loads and the timer begins. The timer starts at 40 seconds (10 seconds per question) and counts down. When incorrect answers are selected, my timer decreases by 10 seconds. If the correct answer is selected, the timer stays the same.

I then hit a large roadblock during this homework and I was struggling to fix certain aspects.

I created this flow chart below to map out what areas were working and not working:
