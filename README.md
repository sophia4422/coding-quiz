# Quiz Theme

When the homework was first presented, I wanted to make the quiz about music. I had an idea of doing a black/green Spotify inspired design. The questions would involve, finish the lyric, guess the album cover, name that song etc. However, for the purposes of time constraints I thought it would be in my best interest to neglect the css and focus more on the functionality of Javascript, as this is my weak point.

I did not want my quiz to focus solely on code related questions, since this was not mandatory to the brief and also has been done multiple times. I decided instead to do a random, general knowledge quiz, with coding included. I started with four basic questions:

**Question 1: What is the capital of Brazil?**
<br> Answers: Brasilia, Rio de Janeiro, SÃ£o Paulo, Ouro Preto

<summary>Answer to Question 1</summary>

**Question 2: What does HTML stand for?**
<br> Answers: HyperText Market Linkup, HyperText Markup Language, Homepage Text Modem Language, How The Market Looks

<details closed>
<summary>Answer to Question 2</summary>
<br>
HyperText Markup Language
</details>

**Question 3: What colours make up the Jamaican flag?**
<br> Answers: Yellow, Black & Green / Red, Yellow & Green / Black, Red & Yellow / Black, Red & Green

<details closed>
<summary>Answer to Question 3</summary>
<br>
Yellow, Black & Green
</details>

**Question 4: What is Bruno Mars' real name?**
<br> Answers: Bruno L. Marshall, Bruno Jupiter, Michael Perez, Peter Gene Hernandez

<summary>Answer to Question 4</summary>

Peter Gene Hernandez

######

At number 39. things started to go wrong. I just wanted to target the Li so I did
if (target.tagName === "LI")
console.log("Clicked Li);
but the console would not read it. Nothing happened when clicked. So I targeted each Li,
LI1, LI2 etc and that way it worked.
I tried to do
if (target.tagName === "LI1" && target.tagName === "LI2") etc to get the same effect for each Li,
but that did not work.
So I have had to target each li1, li2 etc in the if statement. The clicks are read, but I don't know where to go from here.

when the wrong answer is clicked, I want to decrement my timer by -= 10 seconds.
